# Harness providers

`app.harness()` hands a task to a coding agent — a multi-turn worker that reads,
writes, and edits files, then reports back through the same structured-output
contract as `app.ai()`. AgentField ships its own harness, **AForge**, and it is
the default: a call with no provider set runs `aforge`. Naming a different
provider swaps the worker without changing the surrounding loop, which is how
you orchestrate Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, or OpenCode from a reasoner.

## Default: AForge

The `aforge` binary is provisioned alongside the `af` CLI — the curl installer,
the desktop app, and the published Docker images all ship it. To install or
repair it on demand:

```bash
af aforge ensure
```

Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, then call the harness with nothing else configured:

```python
result = await app.harness("Fix the failing test in tests/test_auth.py", schema=Report)
```

```go
result, err := agent.Harness(ctx, task, schema, &dest, harness.Options{Cwd: repoRoot})
```

```ts
const result = await app.harness(task, { schema });
```

The model defaults to AForge's own default. Set `AFORGE_MODEL` to change it
process-wide, or pass `model=` per call.

Verify the runtime before a paid run:

```bash
af harness doctor --provider aforge
```

## Choosing a different provider

Provider selection follows one precedence chain:

| Order | Source | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Explicit value on the call or in the agent's harness config | `app.harness(task, provider="codex")` |
| 2 | `AGENTFIELD_HARNESS_PROVIDER` environment variable | `AGENTFIELD_HARNESS_PROVIDER=claude-code` |
| 3 | Default | `aforge` |

Same loop code, different worker:

```python
# AForge — nothing to configure
report = await app.harness(task, schema=Report)

# Orchestrate Claude Code instead
report = await app.harness(task, schema=Report, provider="claude-code")

# ...or Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode
report = await app.harness(task, schema=Report, provider="codex")
```

The same override exists in every SDK — `harness.Options{Provider: harness.ProviderCodex}`
in Go, `{ provider: 'codex' }` in TypeScript — and an agent-wide default can be
set once on the agent's harness config (`HarnessConfig(provider="codex")` in
Python, `agent.HarnessConfig{Provider: "codex"}` in Go).

## Install

| Provider | Install | Python extra | Required CLI | Authentication |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `aforge` (default) | `af aforge ensure` (shipped with `af`) | None | `aforge` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `claude-code` | `pip install 'agentfield[harness-claude]'` | `agentfield[harness-claude]` | Bundled by `claude-agent-sdk` | Claude login or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `codex` | `npm install -g @openai/codex` | `agentfield[harness-codex]` | `codex` | Codex login or `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `gemini` | `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` | None | `gemini` | Gemini login, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| `opencode` | `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install \| bash` | `agentfield[harness-opencode]` | `opencode` | Provider credentials configured in OpenCode |
| `grok` | Install the Grok Build CLI, then `grok login` | None | `grok` | `XAI_API_KEY` |

Install every Python wrapper with:

```bash
pip install 'agentfield[harness-all]'
```

`aforge` is the one CLI AgentField distributes itself. Every install surface
provisions it beside `af` in `~/.agentfield/bin` — the curl installer, the
desktop app on launch, and the `python-agent` / `go-agent` / cloud control-plane
images. To install or repair it by hand:

```bash
af aforge ensure          # --force re-downloads even when already current
```

The pinned build, its download host and the opt-out are documented under
`AGENTFIELD_AFORGE_BASE_URL` / `AGENTFIELD_SKIP_AFORGE` in
[docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md).

The extras install Python wrappers. They do not replace the runtime preflight:
AForge and Gemini are CLI-only, and Codex or OpenCode may still require a
separately available executable depending on the wrapper and platform. `grok`
is available in the Python SDK only.

### AForge adapter contract

AForge is registered as `aforge` in the Python, Go, and TypeScript SDKs. The
adapters default to the direct non-interactive contract, `aforge exec --json`,
send the task over stdin, and map AForge's usage ledger into AgentField turns,
token counts, and cost metrics. Set `AGENTFIELD_AFORGE_COMMAND=do` to opt into
the routed `aforge do --json --yes-spend` workflow instead.

Set `AFORGE_MAX_CONCURRENT` to cap simultaneous AForge subprocesses. The
default is 8. `AGENTFIELD_HARNESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` is the outer watchdog; each
adapter gives AForge a five-second landing window to emit its exit-2 timeout
envelope. Schema runs use a unique output directory per invocation so parallel
jobs can safely share a checkout. Set `AFORGE_BIN` to an absolute path when the
binary is installed somewhere off `PATH`.

## Model selection and reasoning-effort variants

Every provider accepts a `model` option on `.harness()` calls. Leaving it unset
uses the provider's own default — AForge picks its own model, `claude-code`
keeps using `sonnet`. The model string may carry a reasoning-effort variant
after a `#` separator:

```python
result = await app.harness(
    task,
    provider="opencode",
    model="openrouter/z-ai/glm-5.2#high",
)
```

An explicit `variant="high"` keyword wins over the suffix. Per provider:

| Provider | Model flag | Variant handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aforge` | `exec`: `--model` and `--plan-model`; `do`: `AFORGE_MODEL` (a leading `openrouter/` is stripped) | `AFORGE_EXEC_REASONING` (`off`, `low`, `medium`, or `high`) |
| OpenCode | `-m <model>` | `--variant <v>` (provider-specific effort, e.g. `high`, `max`, `minimal`) |
| Codex | `-m <model>` | `-c model_reasoning_effort=<v>` |
| Claude Code | SDK `model` option | No effort control — variant is dropped with a debug log |
| Gemini | `-m <model>` | No effort control — variant is dropped |

The `#` separator is safe in model ids: `:` belongs to OpenRouter suffixes like
`:free`, and `@` to Vertex-style ids, but no provider uses `#`.

### OpenCode standalone runs (Python)

The Python OpenCode adapter uses `opencode run` for each call; it does not use
`opencode serve` or attach to a session. By default, it selects the fixed
`agentfield-harness` agent with `--agent` and supplies that agent through the
child process's `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` environment variable. The generated
overlay sets `$schema` to `https://opencode.ai/config.json`, selects
`agentfield-harness` as the default agent, and fixes its mode to `primary` with
`steps` set to `500`. It does not modify shared OpenCode configuration files.

The generated overlay is deep-merged into a caller-provided
`OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` value, or into the ambient value when no per-call
value is supplied. The inherited value may be strict JSON or OpenCode-compatible
JSONC with line/block comments and trailing commas. It is parsed before the
merge and emitted to OpenCode as strict JSON. Unrelated providers, agents, MCP
servers, and other configuration remain intact, while AgentField's generated
harness fields take precedence where they overlap. The overlay contains no
provider credentials or API keys. The supplied configuration must be a JSON
object; malformed content is reported instead of being silently discarded. This
boundary applies to `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`; the provider does not read or
rewrite the global `opencode.jsonc` file.

A fixed worker instruction is always included, in the default agent overlay
or in the inline prompt when the rollback is enabled. When a caller supplies a
non-blank `system_prompt`, it precedes that instruction. The resolved base
`model` and `reasoningEffort` are included only when available.
The base model is also passed with `-m`; a resolved `#variant` suffix is
passed exactly once with `--variant`. AgentField `max_turns` remains a runner
limit and is not serialized as OpenCode `steps`.

OpenCode's initial permission baseline is headless and compatibility-oriented:
the wildcard action is allowed. It is followed by a resource-specific `skill`
denial for `agentfield*`, which prevents the child from loading AgentField
orchestration skills while leaving unrelated skills available. OpenCode
evaluates the last matching permission rule, so this ordering is intentional.
`question` and `task` are also explicitly denied, and no `ask` permission is
generated. The Python OpenCode provider currently accepts the common
`tools` and `permission_mode` options but ignores them; it does not translate
tool names into redundant permission entries, and `permission_mode` does not
select an OpenCode permission mode. The wildcard behavior is not per-role
authorization.

For an opt-in rollback or compatibility test, set
`AGENTFIELD_OPENCODE_INLINE_SYSTEM_PROMPT=1` (in the per-call environment or
the ambient environment). That path keeps the generated agent selection and
targeted permissions, removes the selected agent's configured system prompt
from the merged configuration, and places the caller system prompt, fixed
worker instruction, and task into one prompt. POSIX sends that prompt as the
positional argument and Windows sends it over stdin. The default path keeps the
task prompt (including the runner's schema instructions, when applicable) as
the only user-facing prompt and configures the system prompt on the generated
agent.

## Verify

Check selected providers in a container or CI job before any paid run:

```bash
af harness doctor --provider codex,opencode --json
```

The command exits non-zero if a requested provider is missing, its version
cannot be read, or it is otherwise unusable. JSON is still written to stdout so
CI can archive the report when the command fails.

Python applications can use the same preflight data:

```python
reports = await app.harness_doctor(providers=["codex", "opencode"])
for report in reports:
    print(report.provider, report.usable, report.issues)
```

The preflight currently ships in the Python SDK and the `af` CLI. Equivalent
TypeScript and Go SDK APIs are planned follow-ups (see #685) and are not
available yet.

Each report includes the provider name, resolved binary, installed state,
version, auth state, usability, installation command, recognized auth variables,
and machine-readable issues.

The static preflight never performs a paid model request. `auth="configured"`
means a recognized environment variable is present. `auth="unknown"` does not
mean authentication failed: the provider may use a local CLI login that an
offline environment check cannot safely prove. A future explicit liveness probe
can validate provider login without changing the static default.

If a dependency disappears between preflight and execution, providers raise
`HarnessProviderUnavailable` before retrying the task. The exception includes
the provider, missing dependency, and an installation command.
